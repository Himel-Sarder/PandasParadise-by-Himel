Transformations on groupby in pandas involve applying functions that return an output with the same shape as the input, effectively transforming the data within each group. The transform method is used for this purpose. Unlike agg, which reduces the data, transform is used when you want to perform some group-wise calculations but return a DataFrame or Series of the same shape as the original.
