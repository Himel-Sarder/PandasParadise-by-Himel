
Expanding window functions in pandas involve applying an aggregation function cumulatively over all preceding values in a series or dataframe. This means that the window size increases with each new observation.
Unlike rolling window functions, where the window size remains fixed, expanding window functions consider all data points from the beginning up to the current observation.
